# School District Analysis
Report prepared for Module 4 challenge by Hannah Wikum - January 2022

# Resources
* Data Source: clean_students_complete.csv (provided)
* Software: Python 3.7 Anaconda Development Environment, Jupyter Notebook, Git Bash 2.34.1.windows.1

# Overview
## Module
This analysis was performed for Maria, a chief data scientist for a school district. During the module, I prepared standardized test data for 39,170 students across 15 schools in the district by importing a CSV, inspecting the data, and cleaning names before doing a comprehensive analysis. The analysis included:
  * number of students
  * number of schools
  * total  budget
  * average math and reading test scores
  * passing percentages
 The data was further analyzed and presented in data frames by school, school spending/student, school size, and school type. All work was completed in a Jupyter Notebook and committed to this GitHub repository.
 
 ## Challenge
 For the challenge, the school board suspected the math and reading scores for ninth graders at Thomas High School had been altered. I was asked to remove the scores while keeping the remaining data intact to protect the integrity of the standardized testing process. This part of the analysis required two steps:
  1) Replace the math and reading scores for 9th graders at Thomas High School with 'NaN'
  2) Rerun the analysis described above on all remaining data without the impact of the academic dishonesty.

# Results
_Use a bulleted list to answer the following - include pictures of data frames or tables_
1. Impact to district summary
2. Impact to school summary
3. How does replacing the ninth graders' math and reading scores affect Thomas High School's performance relative to the other schools?
4. How does replacing the ninth grade scores affect the following:
5.   math and reading scores by grade
6.   scores by school spending
7.   scores by school size
8.   scores by school type
